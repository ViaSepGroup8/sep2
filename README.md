# warehouse-management-system
This project was created with the intention to simulate a warehouse management system.
Customers can create orders and have the system autonomously create jobs for workers. They will be navigated and instructed to pick up required items in the warehouse in an efficient way. When the order is finished, directions for drivers are provided so that the order is picked up and delivered to the customer.  
This project was created as for educational purposes and is not supposed to be used in a commercial or production environment.
